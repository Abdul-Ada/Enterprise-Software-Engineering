# Pok√©mon Quiz ‚Äì Enterprise Software Engineering Project

## üß† Introduction

This project is a full-stack enterprise-grade web application developed as part of the Enterprise Software Engineering module. It delivers a real-time, interactive quiz experience themed around Pok√©mon trivia, where players must answer progressively more difficult questions under time pressure.

At its core, the application is designed to demonstrate key principles of modern software engineering including modularity, scalability, security, and resilience. It integrates a responsive frontend, real-time serverless backend logic via Supabase Edge Functions, and cloud-hosted storage and authentication through Supabase Postgres and Supabase Auth.

The quiz dynamically fetches data from the public Pok√©API‚Äîensuring each game session is unique‚Äîand tailors question difficulty to the player's score. Players must log in or sign up before participating, and their final scores are submitted to a secure, cloud-hosted leaderboard.

## üöÄ Solution Overview

This application is a full-stack Pok√©mon-themed quiz game designed to simulate the development and deployment of a real-world enterprise application. It integrates cloud-native technologies, dynamic content generation, and secure authentication to deliver a responsive and engaging user experience. The architecture is composed of three key layers‚Äîfrontend, middleware, and backend‚Äîeach fulfilling a distinct role within the system.

**Frontend**

The frontend is a responsive web interface built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. It includes interactive components such as a theme toggle for dark/light modes, keyboard-based input for accessibility and speed, and a visual timer bar to increase gameplay pressure. All user interactions, including login, quiz progression, and leaderboard updates, are dynamically managed on the client side. The interface adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring usability across desktop and mobile devices.

**Middleware (Edge Functions)**

Middleware logic is implemented using Supabase Edge Functions, which serve as the application‚Äôs core API layer. These functions act as stateless services that generate quiz questions based on the player‚Äôs current score‚Äîautomatically adjusting difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard, rare) using live data from the Pok√©API. Question logic is split into modular services (easyQuestions.ts, mediumQuestions.ts, hardQuestions.ts) to ensure maintainability and scalability. The use of Edge Functions ensures low latency and horizontal scalability.

**Backend**

The backend consists of Supabase‚Äôs fully-managed Postgres database and authentication services. Supabase Auth handles secure user signup, login, and session management using JWTs. All user actions‚Äîincluding submitting a score‚Äîrequire valid authentication. The leaderboard is stored in a relational Postgres table with row-level access control (RLS) in place to protect user data. Supabase's real-time capabilities and RESTful endpoints allow seamless integration with the frontend.

**Application Workflow**

- A new user signs up or logs in via the authentication form.

- Upon authentication, they can start a quiz session.

- A GET request is made to the Edge Function with the current score as a query parameter.

- The function selects a Pok√©mon and generates a question, returning choices and a sprite.

- Users answer the question within 15 seconds; if correct, difficulty increases.

- On a wrong answer or timeout, their score is submitted to the leaderboard.

- The leaderboard updates and displays the top scores globally.

## üèóÔ∏è Enterprise Considerations (Fully Expanded with Code Examples & Explanations)
This section outlines the architectural, performance, and engineering decisions that align the Pok√©mon Quiz App with enterprise-grade standards of scalability, security, resilience, and deployment readiness.

**üìà Performance**
Optimized for low latency and minimal overhead on both the client and server.

**‚úÖ Edge Function In-Memory Caching**
To avoid redundant API calls during a single function lifecycle, Pok√©mon data is cached in memory inside the Edge Function.

```
ts
Copy
Edit
// supabase/functions/pokemon-question/index.ts
const cache: Record<string, any> = {};

async function getPokemon(id: number) {
  if (!cache[id]) {
    const res = await fetch(`https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${id}`);
    cache[id] = await res.json();
  }
  return cache[id];
}
```

Why it matters:
While Edge Functions are stateless between invocations, caching during a single run avoids repeated network calls when multiple components (e.g., species data) rely on the same Pok√©mon info.

**‚úÖ Conditional Expensive Fetches**
Expensive calls like species/habitat info are only triggered for high-difficulty questions.

```
ts
Copy
Edit
if (difficulty === 'hard') {
  const speciesRes = await fetch(pokemon.species.url);
  const species = await speciesRes.json();
  const color = species.color.name; // Used in hard questions
}
```

Why it matters:
Minimizes external API load and keeps question generation fast for easier levels.

‚úÖ Frontend Efficiency
Async operations, minimal blocking, and clean UI updates.

```
js
Copy
Edit
// public/client.js
async function getQuestion(score) {
  try {
    const res = await fetch(`/functions/v1/pokemon-question?score=${score}`);
    const question = await res.json();
    renderQuestion(question);
  } catch (err) {
    showError("‚ö†Ô∏è Could not load question.");
  }
}
```

Why it matters:
This ensures a responsive user experience with smooth interactions and low overhead, even on low-powered devices.

**‚öñÔ∏è Scalability**
Built using cloud-native, stateless, and modular principles for horizontal scalability.

**‚úÖ Stateless Edge Functions**
Supabase Edge Functions are stateless and scalable globally.

```
ts
Copy
Edit
Deno.serve(async (req) => {
  const score = Number(new URL(req.url).searchParams.get("score"));
  const question = await generateQuestion(score);
  return new Response(JSON.stringify(question));
});
```

Why it matters:
Stateless architecture allows edge functions to run concurrently and scale automatically without session dependency.

**‚úÖ Modular Codebase for Questions**
Each difficulty level is abstracted into its own file:

```
ts
Copy
Edit
// services/hardQuestions.ts
export function generateSpeedQuestion(pokemon) {
  return {
    question: `What is the base speed of ${pokemon.name}?`,
    options: [...],
    answer: pokemon.stats.find(stat => stat.stat.name === 'speed').base_stat
  };
}
```

Why it matters:
This design allows new question types to be added or modified without affecting other modules‚Äîsupporting long-term maintenance and growth.

**‚úÖ Concurrent Supabase Writes**
Multiple users can save scores at the same time.

```
js
Copy
Edit
await supabase
  .from("leaderboard")
  .insert({ username, score });
```

Why it matters:
Leverages Supabase's scalable Postgres backend, which handles thousands of concurrent operations efficiently.

üõ°Ô∏è Robustness
Resilient to API failures, bad input, and network issues.

‚úÖ Try/Catch Error Handling
All fetch operations are wrapped to avoid app crashes:

```
js
Copy
Edit
try {
  const response = await fetch("/functions/v1/pokemon-question?score=3");
  const data = await response.json();
  displayQuestion(data);
} catch (error) {
  showError("‚ö†Ô∏è Could not load question.");
}
```

Why it matters:
Prevents runtime failures and ensures a fallback or error message is always shown.

**‚úÖ Fallback Supabase Questions**
If the Pok√©API is down or slow, the app fetches a pre-defined fallback question.

```
ts
Copy
Edit
const { data: fallback } = await supabase
  .from("fallback_questions")
  .select("*")
  .order("id", { ascending: false })
  .limit(1)
  .single();

if (!question && fallback) {
  return new Response(JSON.stringify(fallback));
}
```

Why it matters:
Ensures continuity of gameplay even during external API outages.

**‚úÖ User-Friendly Error UI**
Errors are communicated clearly on the frontend.

```
js
Copy
Edit
function showError(message) {
  questionEl.textContent = message;
  resultEl.textContent = "Try refreshing or check your connection.";
}
```

Why it matters:
Improves trust and usability during unexpected events.

**üîê Security**
Implements best practices for protecting data, credentials, and access.

**‚úÖ Authenticated Access with Supabase**
Only logged-in users can access the game and leaderboard.

```
js
Copy
Edit
const { data, error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({
  email,
  password
});
```

Why it matters:
Prevents anonymous misuse and ensures user scores are correctly tracked.

**‚úÖ Secure Backend Key Handling**
Sensitive keys are handled only in Edge Functions, never exposed to the frontend.

```
ts
Copy
Edit
const supabase = createClient(
  Deno.env.get("SUPABASE_URL"),
  Deno.env.get("SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY")
);
```

Why it matters:
Protects elevated privileges and ensures only secure backend operations can modify sensitive data.

**‚úÖ Public-Only Keys on Frontend**
Frontend uses anonKey, restricted by Row-Level Security (RLS).

```
js
Copy
Edit
const supabase = window.supabase.createClient(SUPABASE_URL, ANON_KEY);
```

Why it matters:
Reduces risk of misuse or unauthorized data access from the client side.

**‚úÖ Row-Level Security + Hashed Passwords**
Supabase RLS policies restrict access so users only see and edit their own records.

Supabase hashes passwords by default with secure algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).

Why it matters:
Implements zero-trust security by default, protecting user identity and data integrity.

**üöÄ Deployment**
Designed for rapid iteration and scalable deployment.

**‚úÖ Edge Function Deployment**

```
bash
Copy
Edit
npx supabase functions deploy pokemon-question
```

Why it matters:
Easily deploys stateless functions globally using CLI tools with zero downtime.

**‚úÖ Frontend Local or Cloud Hosting**

```
bash
Copy
Edit
node server.js
```

Why it matters:
Supports local development via Express server or cloud hosting via Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages.

**‚úÖ Secure Environment Variables**

```
env
Copy
Edit
SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-secret-role-key
```

Why it matters:
Prevents credentials from being exposed in public repositories or browser JavaScript.

**‚úÖ CI/CD Ready**
Easily adaptable to GitHub Actions, Netlify Deploy Hooks, or custom pipelines.

```
yaml
Copy
Edit
# .github/workflows/deploy.yml
- name: Deploy Edge Function
  run: npx supabase functions deploy pokemon-question
```
  
Why it matters:
Enables automated testing, linting, and deployment for faster, safer iterations.

## üêõ Known Issues & Future Enhancements
While the Pok√©mon Quiz application is fully functional and aligns with modern enterprise software engineering practices, there are several known limitations that affect user experience and system capabilities. Additionally, a number of enhancements are planned to improve performance, usability, accessibility, and maintainability in future iterations.

**üîç Known Issues**

Incomplete or Inconsistent Data from Pok√©API
Some Pok√©mon entries retrieved from the Pok√©API may lack complete metadata such as missing sprites, undefined species classifications, or inconsistent ability/type structures. This can cause the application to skip certain questions or fall back to backup data stored in the fallback_questions table. Although the system handles these gracefully, it limits question variety and difficulty. To mitigate this, the Edge Function attempts to detect incomplete data and substitutes a fallback question to maintain continuity.

Leaderboard Requires Manual Refresh
The leaderboard is updated using a static SELECT query triggered on page load or after a score submission. It currently does not support real-time updates, meaning players won‚Äôt see newly submitted scores unless the page is manually refreshed. This can diminish the competitive experience by delaying feedback on ranking.

Minimal Profile & Score Management
The application uses the authenticated user's email as the display name and does not support custom usernames, profile editing, or avatars. Users can only submit a score once per session unless they explicitly confirm overwriting. Additionally, multiple scores from the same user are not clearly differentiated. This limits personalization and may confuse users wishing to track multiple attempts or high scores.

Limited Error Feedback & Recovery Options
While most API failures are caught and handled with alerts, certain issues (e.g., login/signup errors, network issues) do not provide granular error feedback. Users cannot retry failed operations without refreshing the page, and errors are not always explained (e.g., password too weak, email already taken). This can hinder accessibility for non-technical users.

Lack of Offline Support
The application depends entirely on live connections to Pok√©API and Supabase. There is no caching strategy or service worker in place to support offline functionality. As a result, the app cannot load or play in low-connectivity environments, and submissions cannot be retried once a connection is lost.

**üå± Future Enhancements**

Real-Time Leaderboard with Supabase Realtime
Integrating Supabase Realtime will allow instant updates to leaderboard scores across all clients. This would enable automatic re-rendering of the leaderboard when a new score is inserted, creating a live competition experience without requiring refreshes.

Audio Feedback & Animations
To increase engagement and accessibility, sound effects (e.g., for correct/wrong answers or timers) and animations (e.g., transitions, score flashes) could be added. This would create a more immersive gameplay environment‚Äîespecially appealing to younger users.

OAuth Login Support
Support for third-party authentication (Google, GitHub, Apple) using Supabase Auth providers is planned. This will reduce friction during sign-up and improve accessibility on mobile devices where typing passwords is less convenient.

Accessibility Improvements
Planned improvements include full screen reader compatibility, keyboard-only navigation, ARIA labeling, and colorblind-friendly theme options. These changes will broaden usability for users with visual, motor, or cognitive impairments.

Multi-Language Support (i18n)
Internationalization will be implemented by externalizing all UI text into translation files (e.g., en.json, es.json). This will make the app more inclusive and usable by non-English speakers.

Profile Management & Session History
Future versions may allow users to set custom usernames and avatars, track their quiz attempt history, and view or reset past scores. This encourages repeat playthroughs and opens the door to gamification features like badges or milestones.

Offline Support via PWA & Caching
Implementing a Service Worker would allow the app to cache key assets, detect offline status, and retry submissions once a connection is restored. This would make the app more reliable in environments with unstable internet access.

Automated CI/CD Deployment
GitHub Actions or similar pipelines will be integrated to automatically deploy Edge Functions and frontend code on commit. These workflows will also run tests and enforce linting to maintain code quality.

Unit, Integration & E2E Testing
Test coverage will be expanded using tools like Vitest or Jest for backend logic, and Playwright or Cypress for frontend end-to-end testing. Mock APIs will be introduced for simulating Supabase responses without relying on live data, improving reliability and development speed.
