# Pok√©mon Quiz ‚Äì Enterprise Software Engineering Project

## üß† Introduction

This project is a full-stack enterprise web application developed for the **Enterprise Software Engineering** module. It is a secure, scalable, and responsive Pok√©mon quiz game that pulls live data from the Pok√©API using Supabase Edge Functions. Players answer progressively harder questions within a time limit, and their scores are submitted to a live leaderboard. The app showcases enterprise principles such as modular architecture, cloud deployment, and robust error handling.

## üöÄ Solution Overview

This application is a full-stack Pok√©mon-themed quiz game that combines real-time data, secure authentication, and dynamic gameplay. Built using Supabase and vanilla JavaScript, the solution features three integrated layers:

- **Frontend**: A responsive interface with theme toggle, keyboard support, and animations that delivers an engaging user experience.
- **Middleware**: Supabase Edge Functions dynamically generate quiz questions based on player score and difficulty, using real-time data from the Pok√©API.
- **Backend**: Supabase Postgres stores leaderboard scores, while Supabase Auth secures login/signup and enforces access control.

The game adapts question difficulty as the user progresses, supports user authentication, and records scores in a global leaderboard. Error handling and fallback mechanisms ensure the app remains responsive even during API issues. The architecture is modular, scalable, and optimized for performance and security.

## üìå Project Aim & Objectives

### **Aim**

The primary aim of this project is to **design, build, and deploy a secure, responsive, and scalable full-stack quiz application** that showcases enterprise-grade architecture. The application is intended to demonstrate how dynamic APIs, real-time data processing, and secure authentication can be integrated using modern cloud-based technologies like Supabase.

### **Objectives**

- ‚úÖ **Implement Dynamic Question Logic**  
  Use Supabase Edge Functions and Pok√©API to generate dynamic, real-time quiz questions that scale with the user's score.

- ‚úÖ **Enable Secure User Authentication**  
  Use Supabase Auth to handle user registration, login, and logout, ensuring secure access to the app and leaderboard.

- ‚úÖ **Create a Real-Time Leaderboard System**  
  Store scores in Supabase Postgres. Implement update logic to prevent duplicate entries and maintain a competitive global ranking.

- ‚úÖ **Design an Interactive and Accessible Frontend**  
  Build a responsive and engaging UI with dark mode, keyboard controls, and animations for all screen sizes.

- ‚úÖ **Ensure Enterprise-Level Architecture**  
  Apply modular code structure, error handling, cloud deployment, and environment variable security practices.

## üìã Feature Overview

| Feature | Purpose | Code Location & Components |
|--------|---------|-----------------------------|
| **Dynamic Quiz Engine** | Dynamically generates quiz questions based on the user‚Äôs score. The difficulty increases with progress‚Äîfrom type-based to classification-based questions. | `supabase/functions/pokemon-question/index.ts`<br>`services/easyQuestions.ts`, `mediumQuestions.ts`, `hardQuestions.ts` |
| **Leaderboard System** | Displays the top 5 scores and allows players to submit or update their scores after each session. Duplicate usernames are prompted for confirmation. | `client.js` (`loadLeaderboard()`, `saveScore()`)<br>Supabase leaderboard table<br>`index.html` (`#leaderboard`) |
| **User Authentication** | Secure login/signup using Supabase Auth. Users must be authenticated before accessing the quiz. Session is tracked and login state affects UI rendering. | `client.js` (`signupBtn`, `loginBtn`, `logoutBtn`, `handleAuth()`)<br>`index.html` (`#auth-section`) |
| **Edge Function Endpoint** | Edge Function acts as the core API for quiz question generation. Responds to GET requests with a difficulty-adjusted question payload. | `supabase/functions/pokemon-question/index.ts`<br>Endpoint: `/functions/v1/pokemon-question?score=X` |
| **Dark/Light Theme Toggle** | Enhances user experience by letting users switch between dark and light UI themes with a single click. | `client.js` (`themeToggle.onclick`)<br>`styles.css`, `index.html` |
| **Keyboard Input** | Improves accessibility and responsiveness by letting users answer via keyboard (1‚Äì4). | `client.js` (`getQuestion()`, `document.onkeydown`) |
| **Timer & Visual Bar** | Each question has a 15-second timer with a visual progress bar. Auto-triggers end if time runs out. | `client.js` (`startTimer()`), `styles.css`, `index.html` |
| **Responsive UI Design** | Ensures the app is usable across screen sizes with flexible layouts and modern UI. | `styles.css` (media queries, flexbox/grid), `index.html` |
| **Error Handling & Fallbacks** | Handles API errors, login/signup failures, and Supabase issues with user-friendly messages. | `client.js` (alerts, fallback logic)<br>`index.ts` (fallback from Supabase DB) |

## üèóÔ∏è Enterprise Considerations

| Area | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Performance** | Supabase Edge Functions minimize load using caching. Expensive operations like species lookup are conditional. Lightweight frontend logic ensures a responsive experience. |
| **Scalability** | Stateless edge functions scale horizontally. Supabase Postgres supports concurrent read/writes. Modular code enables easy feature extensions. |
| **Robustness** | All fetch and async logic uses `try/catch`. Fallback content is loaded from a Supabase table if the Pok√©API fails. |
| **Security** | Only the `anonKey` is exposed on the frontend. Supabase Auth is used for secure authentication. Passwords are hashed. RLS protects sensitive data. |
| **Deployment** | Supabase Edge Functions are deployed via CLI. Frontend is served via `node server.js` or hosted on Netlify/Vercel. Environment variables manage credentials securely. |

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Usage Instructions

### üîß Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- Supabase CLI
- Supabase account/project

### ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Steps

```bash

## üêõ Known Issues & Future Enhancements

While the Pok√©mon Quiz application is fully functional and demonstrates key enterprise software engineering principles, there are a few known limitations and opportunities for future improvement.

### Known Issues

Some Pok√©mon entries returned by the Pok√©API may be missing data such as sprites or species classifications, which can result in fallback questions. The leaderboard currently supports only simple username tracking via email. Real-time updates are not implemented yet and require a page refresh. Some network errors may display fallback UI but not always offer retry options.

### Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include real-time leaderboard updates using Supabase Subscriptions, adding sound effects and animations, and offering OAuth login support (Google/GitHub). UI accessibility improvements, multi-language support, and fully automated CI/CD deployment pipelines are also on the roadmap. Automated testing (unit and integration) will improve long-term reliability and maintainability.
